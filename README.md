## What is this?
- This is a proof of concept-turned work in progress for a network streamed ESP fuser video feed.
- ESP video feed uses an RGBA video format for alpha layer blending of ESP over gameplay without any 3rd party chroma/greenscreen software.(No black background to remove)
- This is a Work In Progress(WIP), changes may completely change the flow of the code, do not rely on stability.

## What is changed?
- Speed increased from 1.2x to 1.4x (PvE Suggested)
- Wide Lean modified for 3 levels of Huge Lean Upwards (PvE Suggested)
- Loot through walls 10x extend range (PvE Suggested)
- Added Loot Info Widget (PvE Suggested)
- FPS no longer shown in window title
- ESP Window Options:
  - Always on Top
  - Chroma (black)

- Added Loot Info Widget
  - Shows a loot table sorted by highest price, can click on each item to draw a line to its destination.
