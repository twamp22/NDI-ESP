# Twamp's (WIP) NDI ESP

## What is this?
- This is a proof of concept-turned work in progress for a network streamed ESP fuser video feed.
- ESP video feed uses an RGBA video format for alpha layer blending of ESP over gameplay without any 3rd party chroma/greenscreen software.(No black background to remove)
- This is a Work In Progress(WIP), changes may completely change the flow of the code, do not rely on stability.

## Testers welcome!
- I have only tested this on a number of my personal machines! Feel free to build it, run it and try to break it but please provide feedback to me via discord DM.
